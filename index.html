# Lost Cars Listing Website

A mobile-first web platform to help list and search for lost cars using license plate or chassis numbers.  
**Admin-controlled:** Only you (the admin) can upload, edit, or remove listings, upload car images, and manage contact information.  
**Privacy-first:** Sensitive details and images are kept private, and your contact number is only revealed if a car is found.

## Features

- **Add Lost Cars** (Admin-only): Upload car details and images.
- **Public Search:** Anyone can search for a car by license plate or chassis number.
- **Private Images/Contacts:** Only admin can view/edit images and sensitive info.
- **Contact Workflow:** If a car is found, user submits a form, admin verifies, then shares contact number.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Optimized UI for use on any phone.
